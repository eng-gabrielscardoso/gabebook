# Gabebook's Architecture

This application is a Fullstack application made with [NuxtJS.](https://nuxt.com)

In order to organise and advance with application development, we use the [Architecture Decision Records (ADR) Model.](https://adr.github.io/)

---

## Decision

> Describe here our response to these forces, that is, the design decision that was made. State the decision in full sentences, with active voice ("We will...").

## Rationale

> Describe here the rationale for the design decision. Also indicate the rationale for significant rejected alternatives. This section may also indicate assumptions, constraints, requirements, and results of evaluations and experiments.

## Status

> [Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded] If deprecated, indicate why. If superseded, include a link to the new ADR.

## Consequences

> Describe here the resulting context, after applying the decision. All consequences should be listed, not just the "positive" ones.
